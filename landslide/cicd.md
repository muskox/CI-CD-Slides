## What is CI
- Every merge to git master should fire off CI Pipeline.
- Code is built/rendered. If that fails, stop here.
- Automated tests are run. If tests fail, stop here.
- Assets pushed to Asset repository.
- Stage Environment loaded with new Assets.
- Stage Environemt fully works without human intervention.
